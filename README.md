# Android_adding_dependencies
How to add dependencies in an Android Java based Project in Android Studio using:
  1) existing online libraries, JSON converter as example;
  2) downloaded JAR files, XML converter as exmaple using JDOM;
  3) creating your own Java Library

Details in the comments in the MainActivity.java file

For this project:
android {
    compileSdkVersion 29
    buildToolsVersion "29.0.2"

Not that it is relevant as the project was created mearily to try this library imports but project is emulated using Genymotion
